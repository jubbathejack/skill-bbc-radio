## BBC Radio Skill
Mycroft skill to play BBC radio stations (currently only BBC Radio 1).

## Description 
A Mycroft skill to play BBC radio stations. I intend to implement a feature to allow for dynamic
selection of any of the radio stations that the BBC operates. It currently is only configured
to play BBC radio 1 just to get the skill up and running. I then intend to implement the
feature for multiple stations.

## Examples 
* "BBC Radio 1"
* "Radio 1"
